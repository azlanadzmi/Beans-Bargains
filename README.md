            <h2>Chapter 2: Hardware</h2>
            <p>Hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system, allowing it to perform tasks and operations. These include devices such as keyboards, mice, and scanners, which enable users to input data, and output devices like monitors and printers that display or produce results. Storage units, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and cloud storage, ensure data is safely stored for both immediate and long-term use.</p>
            <p>The central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) are critical for processing instructions and handling graphical tasks. Understanding how these components connect through the system architecture, such as motherboards and data buses, is essential for designing efficient systems. Hardware performance is influenced by factors like processing speed, memory size, and storage capacity. Recent advancements in hardware technology include quantum computing, IoT-enabled devices, and eco-friendly designs aimed at boosting efficiency and sustainability.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3: Software</h2>
            <p>Software represents the intangible side of computer systems, encompassing programs and applications that allow hardware to function effectively. This includes operating systems like Windows and Linux, which manage hardware resources and provide a platform for other programs. Application software is designed for specific purposes, such as creating documents, editing photos, or managing business operations. Middleware acts as a link, enabling seamless communication between software applications and operating systems.</p>
            <p>Developing software involves a structured process known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC), which includes planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying. Modern trends in software development include the adoption of open-source solutions, cloud-based applications, and AI-powered tools that improve user experiences and automate tasks. The seamless integration of software with hardware, facilitated by drivers and firmware, ensures systems work smoothly and efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: Information Systems and SAD</h2>
            <p>Information systems are tools that help organizations manage and process data efficiently, supporting activities such as decision-making and problem-solving. These systems include tools for routine tasks (transaction processing systems), tools for analyzing information (management information systems), and systems that aid in complex decision-making (decision support systems).</p>
            <p>System analysis focuses on understanding user requirements and defining what a system needs to achieve. Techniques like flowcharts and data mapping are used to outline how data moves and interacts within the system. System design translates these insights into a functional system by defining database structures, interfaces, and the overall system architecture. Building an information system follows a development cycle with stages like planning, analysis, design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance. Todayâ€™s information systems often leverage cloud computing, big data, and AI technologies to offer smarter and more adaptive solutions to meet user needs.</p>
